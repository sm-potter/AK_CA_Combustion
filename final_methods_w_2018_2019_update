1.  Run all of sols burned area code in the order he suggests.  This will out put the 3 band rasters.

2.  Now turn these pixels into latitude and longitude so we can get the ClimateNA variables.  This script is located in /mnt/data1/boreal/spotter/scripts/combustion_final2/R/2018_2019/get_all_burn_pixels.R

3. Now extract the non-vi predictors in EE, using the resulting modis_for_ee shapefile.  This is in /users/spotter/default/combustion/export_predictors_table_fwi

4. Now extract the vi predictors in EE, using the resulting modis_for_ee shapefile.  This is in /users/spotter/default/combustion/export_vi_predictors_2018_2019

5. Now extract the fwi predictors in EE, using the resulting modis_for_ee shapefile.  This is in /users/spotter/default/combustion/fwi_extract_final_preds_2018_2019

6. File: extract_orig_modis_veg.R
Location: (cloud ops) /mnt/data1/boreal/spotter/scripts/combustion_final2/R/2019/2019
Notes: This file will extract all the native resolution 500m vegetation (JP, WS etc) predictors.

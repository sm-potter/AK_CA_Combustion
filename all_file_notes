-------------------------------------------------------Files for anything associated with model training
File: prepare_all_spatial_vars.R
Local: (cloud ops) /mnt/data1/boreal/spotter/scripts/combustion_final/R
Notes: This script will take all the original spatial variables I got as detailed in Readme_BR.docx and only select the
variable related to fire weather indicies, DOB and climate NA.  All other variables I will be aquireing my self in subsequent
scripts.  This script also updates belowground combustion from a file I got from Xanthe which includes CMD estimates.

File: all_training_extraction
Location: (ee) users/spotter/default/combustion
Notes:  This script will take all the training pts from prepare_all_spatial_vars.R and extract ndvi, ndii, tasseledp cap, dnbr,
rbr, and rdnbr from harmonized landsat. It will also get pat burnd dem variable such as elevation, aspect, slope and twi.
Note that twi here was processed on cloud ops, no definitive script to link at this point.

File: fwi_extract_training.R
Location: (cloud ops) /mnt/data1/boreal/spotter/scripts/combustion_final/R
Notes: This will extract all the GFWED v2.5 FWI indices for the training data

File: stand_age_training_extract.R
Location: (cloud ops) /mnt/data1/boreal/spotter/scripts/combustion_final/R
Notes: This will extract all the stand ages using Beadoin/Pan/historical fires in AK (script not yet attached, but
the output of the script is linked to this R file) for the training data.

File: join_all_training.R
Location: (cloud ops) /mnt/data1/boreal/spotter/scripts/combustion_final/R
Notes: This will join all the spatial files together

File: model_training.R
Location: (cloud ops) /mnt/data1/boreal/spotter/scripts/combustion_final/R
Notes: Optimize the tuning parameters with a random search grid across a series of models, and compare the distribution
of the R2 across a 10 fold cross validation repeated 100 times.  Output top four models for both stand age and
not stand age included as well as performance metrics. Residual plots are also created as well as the residual 
error across 10 bins which are smoothed with a loess function for a monte carlo analysis.

File: model_training_rfe.R
Location: (cloud ops) /mnt/data1/boreal/spotter/scripts/combustion_final/R
Notes: Run a recursive feature elinination to get most useful variables. Optimize the tuning parameters with a random search 
grid across a series of models, and compare the distributionof the R2 across a 10 fold cross validation repeated 100 times. 
Final model versions for ranger and svm are output. Residual plots are also created as well as the residual 
error across 10 bins which are smoothed with a loess function for a monte carlo analysis.

File: model_training_rfe_no_age.R
Location: (cloud ops) /mnt/data1/boreal/spotter/scripts/combustion_final/R
Notes: Same as model_training_rfe.R but remove stand age from the training set

File: model_training_rfe_no_fwi.R
Location: (cloud ops) /mnt/data1/boreal/spotter/scripts/combustion_final/R
Notes: Same as model_training_rfe.R but remove fwi's from the training set

File: model_training_rfe_no_fwi_age.R
Location: (cloud ops) /mnt/data1/boreal/spotter/scripts/combustion_final/R
Notes: Same as model_training_rfe.R but remove fwi's and agefrom the training set

File: model_training_colinear_rfe.R
Location: (cloud ops) /mnt/data1/boreal/spotter/scripts/combustion_final/R
Notes: Train with rfe but also use a colinearity removal

File: model_training_colinear_rfe_weights.R
Location: (cloud ops) /mnt/data1/boreal/spotter/scripts/combustion_final/R
Notes: Apply weights to samples in the top 90% and 10% quantiles to try to correct bias, ontop of a recursive feature
elimination. 

File: model_training_colinear_rfe_smoter.R
Location: (cloud ops) /mnt/data1/boreal/spotter/scripts/combustion_final/R
Notes: Use the SMOTER algorithm to balance out the classes.  E.g. reduce the small C values and increase the large
ones with synthetic data.  Package here, https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/UBL/versions/0.0.6/topics/SmoteRegress

File: model_training_colinear_rfe_bias_linear.R
Location: (cloud ops) /mnt/data1/boreal/spotter/scripts/combustion_final/R
Notes: Apply weights to samples in the top 90% and 10% quantiles to try to correct bias, ontop of a recursive feature
elimination. Also attempt to predict residuals with a linear model and then 

File: rf_permute.R
Location: (cloud ops) /mnt/data1/boreal/spotter/scripts/combustion_final/R
Notes: Fine the significant variables in a random forest for both stand age and not
stand age included.  Get a final model using only the significant variables and output the final
performance metric as well as variable importance and variables selected. Final model versions for ranger and svm
are output. Residual plots are also created as well as the residual 
error across 10 bins which are smoothed with a loess function for a monte carlo analysis.


-------------------------------------------------------Files for anything associated with scaling
Note!!! These next series of files apply to four folders in cloud ops under combustion/R/scaling
The only difference in the scripts is they refernece differen't pixel samples, as judged by sols
burn area product.  The root combustion/R/scaling scripts apply to pixles 100% burned and 100% vegetated.
combustion/R/scaling/mixed_fire_mixed_veg is <100% burned and <100% vegetated
combustion/R/scaling/mixed_fire_pured_veg is <100% burned and 100% vegetated
combustion/R/scaling/pure_fire_mixed_veg is 100% burned and <100% vegetated
combustion/R/scaling/combined is all four of the above pixels above combined, which will be our final comparison
for the paper.  All EE scripts listed below also have files in my EE account associated with these differen't folders
except for combustion/R/scaling/combined which was not necessary.

In EE combustion/R/scaling can be referred to as original and 'pure_fire_pure_veg'. 

File: get_modis_pixels.R
Location: (cloud ops) /mnt/data1/boreal/spotter/scripts/combustion/R/scaling
Notes: This will pull out based on sols burn detection files pixels that are 100% landsat classified burned
and 100% vegetated.  200 pixels are then samples and .shp and .tif of these samples are exported, including
coordinates used for climate_na extraction. This is for the years 2004, 2006, 2012, 2014 and 2015. 

File: all_above_scenes.R
Location: (cloud ops) /mnt/data1/boreal/spotter/scripts/combustion/R/scaling
Notes: For the 200 samples pixels in get_modis_pixels.R find which landsat pixels are in the MODIS sub pixels,
since we are comparing the difference in the two scales.

File: get_all_landsat_modis_centroids.R
Location: (cloud ops) /mnt/data1/boreal/spotter/scripts/combustion/R/scaling
Notes: Convert landsat 30m resolution tiles from jwang to points and intersect with sampled landsat pixels.  
Export this file as a shp for EE and a csv, which links landsat specific ids to modis specific ids, both individual years (ID2) 
and all years combined (ID1). 
Landsat Ids come with landsat ID first. Also export .csv file with info for climant_na extraction for landsat.

File: extract_points_modis_native
Location: (ee) users/spotter/default/combustion/pure_fire_pure_veg
Notes: This will extract all the modis sampled points described above at modis resolution for all spatial variables.
vegetation indexes come from the MODIS sensor itself, all others come from native sources and then resampled to 500m

File: extract_points_landsat_resample
Location: (ee) users/spotter/default/combustion/pure_fire_pure_veg

File: extract_points_landsat_native_landsat
Location: (ee) users/spotter/default/combustion/pure_fire_pure_veg
Notes: This will extract all the landsat sampled points at landsat resolution for vegetation indices such as NDVI
NDII, dNBR tasseled cap etc. Tree cover, Soil and topography are also included here. This script applies to any native resolution 
UNDER 500m. Landsat sensor is used. 

File: extract_points_landsat_native_rest
Location: (ee) users/spotter/default/combustion/pure_fire_pure_veg
Notes: This will extract all the modis sampled points for all variables 500m or ABOVE.  While this data is extracted at 
modis level, it is later joined into the landsat sub pixels which match any given modis pixels.  This was done to save
compute time.

File: prepare_all_spatial_vars.R
Local: (cloud ops) /mnt/data1/boreal/spotter/scripts/combustion_final/R
Notes: This script will take all the original spatial variables I got as detailed in Readme_BR.docx and only select the
variable related to fire weather indicies, DOB and climate NA.  All other variables I will be aquireing my self in subsequent
scripts.  This script also updates belowground combustion from a file I got from Xanthe which includes CMD estimates.

File: all_training_extraction
Location: (ee) users/spotter/default/combustion
Notes:  This script will take all the training pts from prepare_all_spatial_vars.R and extract ndvi, ndii, tasseledp cap, dnbr,
rbr, and rdnbr from harmonized landsat. It will also get pat burnd dem variable such as elevation, aspect, slope and twi.
Note that twi here was processed on cloud ops, no definitive script to link at this point.

File: fwi_extract_training.R
Location: (cloud ops) /mnt/data1/boreal/spotter/scripts/combustion_final/R
Notes: This will extract all the GFWED v2.5 FWI indices for the training data

File: stand_age_training_extract.R
Location: (cloud ops) /mnt/data1/boreal/spotter/scripts/combustion_final/R
